    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise my potential client to secure his or her website by assuring that their website is hosted on a secure connection with HTTPS. I would also recommend that they keep users with admin-access to a bare minimum. I would have them block SQL-injections serverside, and regularly do vulnerability scans. I would set up SameSite cookies and configure the cross origin resource sharing-policy for any external resource.</p>
